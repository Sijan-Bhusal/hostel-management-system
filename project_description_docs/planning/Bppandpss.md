## Project overview

### Introduction

Hostel management is an important for accommodation facility for
average time like for student s in bachelors. Managing a hostel
involves tracking student details, room allocations, fee payments,
visitor entries, and complaint handling etc. Mostly nowadays,
these tasks are performed manually, leading to inefficiencies,
errors, and minimal transparency. A Hostel Management System is
designed to help and accomplish these above operations. By using
current technology,hostel in ktm or others can manage their hostel
affairs efficiently, reduce physcial work, and improve the living
ways for hosteler. This proposal helps to fulfill the need,
feasibility, and structure of an effective hostel management and
students like us can easily communicate and receive information
through online methods.

### Objective

Give quick access to info

- Hostelers can check info through online medias.

Use rooms and space better

- Help manage hostel rooms and resources in a smart way.

Improve communication

- Let hostelers report problems easily and check the problem is solved or not.
  Make updates for the system from time to time

### Scope

The scope of the hostel management system includes the design, development,
and implementation of a web sites to manage all hostel-related activities.
This system will handle registrations, room assignment, payments records,
complaints, and daily attendance. It will reduce paperwork, improve data
accuracy, and save time for both students and hostel staff. The system can
be used by wardens, administrators, and students, with different access
control. In the future, the system can also be expanded to include features
like online payments, mobile access, and automated notifications.

### System description

The Hostel Management System is a central digital platform that enables
hostel owners, staff, to manage all hostel-related tasks in a structured
and more interactive manner.

The system will feature:

- Student Registration Module:
  Allows new and returning students to register and update personal details.

- Room no Allocation Module:
  Assigns rooms based on predefined rules like availability, gender, and preference.

- Fee Management Module:
  Tracks payments and sends reminders for due payments.

- Complain Handling Module:
  Enables students to complaints and track their status.

- Attendance Tracking Module:
  Logs student attendance and monitors in/out entries.

### Feasibility Assessment

1. Technical Feasibility:
   The system can be developed using technologies JavaScript with frameworks such as Node.js. The database may use MySQL or PostgreSQL for scalability. Various other tools are used for additional support systems.
2. Operational Feasibility:
   With user-friendly interfaces and guided workflows, hostel staff and students can adopt the system with minimal training. Online documentation and help sections will be provided. The system can be implemented mostly in city areas where there is a dire need for hostel service.
3. Economic Feasibility:
   Most of the economic needs are mostly for hardware and other technical supports and web site creation.

**_Net investment:_**
Around 3 lakh or less.

**_Return of investment (ROI):_**
Within 3 year or less

**_Revenue generation source:_**
Add a fee of around 250 for each students per months

**_Assuming 50 persons in hostelper year:_**
50\*12\*250=Nrs 150000 per annum

**_Break even point:_**
2.5 years around.

### Management Issues

#### Problems:

1. **_Data Security:_**
   We will use encryption for sensitive data like student records and
   financial transactions. Authentication mechanisms such as password
   policies and role-based access control will be enforced.

2. **_User Training:_**
   Training sessions and manuals should be provided to ensure smooth
   learning for hostelers and owners.

3. **_Change Management:_**
   If there are any changes then procedures will be followed accordingly and implemented.

4. **_Maintenance and Updates:_**
   Regular updates, bug fixes, and technical support should be planned.

5. **_Backup and Disaster Recovery:_**
   Unexpected loss of data must have some backup and recovery methods

# PROJECT SCOPE STATEMENT

**_Project Name:_** Hostel management system

## Project goals:

The hostel system is being developed to make the process of
managing hostel-related activities easier, faster, and more
organized. Right now, many hostels manage student records,
room , fee payments, and complaints using paper methods like
paperwork or Excel sheets. This can be slow, confusing, and
lead to mistakes. The main goal of this project is to
create an easy-to-use online system that will help hostel
staff and students handle all hostel tasks more efficiently.
The system will reduce paperwork, improve record-keeping, and
allow both students and owners to access important information quickly.

## Objectives:

The objectives of the system include allowing students to register
online, request hostel rooms, and pay their hostel fees through
a secure website. Administrators/owners will be able to assign rooms,
monitor availability, view fee payments, and handle student complaints
more easily. The system will also generate reports that show data
like how many rooms are filled, how many students still owe fees,
and the number of complaints submitted and resolved. This helps
staff make better decisions and track hostel performance. The
system will also be secure, ensuring that only authorized users
can access sensitive information using passwords and role-based access.

## Project Requirements:

The project will include all necessary features such as student
registration, room management, fee tracking, complaint handling,
and reporting. It will be a web-based application, which means it
can be accessed using a browser on a computer or mobile device.
It will be designed to work well on different screen sizes and
will be simple to use for people with basic computer skills.
The system should be reliable, running smoothly most of the time,
and be able to support many users at once. Backup and recovery
options will be included in case of data loss or technical problems.

Proper and necessary modules
Proper recovery and managers
Documentations

## Project Scope Descriptions:

The Hostel Management System is a web-based application designed to
help manage the day-to-day activities of a student hostel.
It will allow students to register, apply for rooms, pay fees,
and submit complaints online. At the same time, hostel administrators
can manage room allotments, track fee payments, handle complaints,
and generate reports through an easy-to-use dashboard.

The system will include important features such as student login,
room management, fee tracking, complaint handling, notifications,
and reporting. It will be accessible from any device with internet
and designed to be user-friendly for both students and staff.

This project includes the full development and setup of the system,
testing, and basic training for users. It will improve the speed,
accuracy, and convenience of hostel operations while reducing paperwork
and manual errors.

## Project constraints and exclusions:

The Hostel Management System will be developed with a clear scope,
and certain features or services will be excluded from the initial
version. First, the system will be designed only as a web-based
platform and will not include a mobile application. It will also
not be integrated with other hostel and only a specified hostel
or payment gateways during this phase. In addition, features that
require specialized hardware will not be included. Ongoing
maintenance and technical support will be provided for a period
after deployment and long-term support is not planned.

The project also faces a few constraints. It must be completed
within a 2-week timeline and stay within a budget limit i.e the
future updates might need extra money. The system will be hosted
on the university’s existing IT infrastructure, meaning no new
hardware or server resources will be purchased. Additionally,
the design assumes that all users—students, staff, and
administrators—have at least basic computer and internet skills
to use the system effectively.

## Project assumptions:

This project is based on a few assumption that are expected to be
true throughout the development and deployment of the Hostel
Management System. They help to ensure good progress and
successful implementation. It is assumed that the hostelers will
provide authentic information as well as the owner . It is also
assumed that necessary hardware, internet connectivity, and
support will be ready before deployment. The hostlers and owners
are expected to know the basic use of our website and phone and
others guides. The project will use open-source tools and
technologies, so no extra costs are anticipated.

## Project deliverables:

At the end of the project, several important items will be provided
to make sure the Hostel Management System works properly and can be
used easily by students and staff. These deliverables include the
working system, helpful guides, and training to get started.

- A fully working web-based Hostel Management System.
- User manuals and simple guidance materials for students, staff, and admins.
- Full project documentation, including system design and test results.
- A training session for hostel staff and administrators to learn how to use the system.
