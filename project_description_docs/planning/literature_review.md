## 1. Existing Hostel Management Systems
After looking at many research papers and existing software, we found that most hostel management systems focus on four main things:
- Automated student onboarding with digital forms (Kumar & Sharma, 2020)
- Online payment systems built into the software (geniuseduerp)
- Biometric-based attendance (ezeeAbsolute).
- Visitor log management (hostelsnap)
- Algorithms for optimal room distribution (Patel et al., 2021).


But the problem is these systems are mostly made for big university hostels with lots of money to spend. They need strong internet connections and skilled technical manpower to operate. When we checked, none of them were really made for small hostels like Hue Hostel in Nepal.



## Missing  in Current Systems
After reviewing the research papers and software operations, we noticed some gaps in those systems:
- No systems designed specifically for Nepalese hostels.
- Nothing made for small budget operations
- Most systems are too complicated for first-time computer users

## Need for a Custom Solution
Currently, Hue Hostel does everything manually using paper. This causes many problems:
- Slow work: Writing everything by hand takes too much time.
- Data risks: Paper files can get damaged or lost.
- Money mistakes: Manual fee collection leads to errors.

That's why we're building our own custom HMS just for them. We want to replace all those messy paper records and manual processes with a simple digital system that works perfectly for Hue Hostel's specific requirements.

## Plans for HMS System
Our plan combines several good ideas from our research:

- Using flexible development methods so we can adjust as we go.
- Designing specifically for the people who will use it.
- Keeping costs very low (adding a fee of Rs.250 for each students per month).



## Implementation model for HMS System 

The HMS will be developed using Traditional Waterfall Model. Following are the phases desribed in detail:

 **Phase 1: Requirements Gathering**
  
  - Conduct interviews with hostel warden, staffs and students for understanding about hostel administrative needs and student pain points.
  - Document everything from room allocation rules to fee payment schedules.

 **Phase 2: Planning**
 
 Establish the fundamental blueprint for the entire Hostel Management System project by creating the Baseline Project Plan (BPP) which includes: 
  - Project Definition
  - Scope Descriptions
  - Resource Planning
  - Timeline Establishment
  - Project Constraints & Assumptions

 **Phase 3: Analysis**
Perform deep analysis on following areas:
- Functional & Non functional requirements
- Risk Analysis
- Fesibility study
- Process & Data Modelling
- Interface Analysis 

 **Phase 4: Design**
Create system design for Hostel Management System:
- Process Model Design (Level 0,1 DFD)
- Data Model Design (ER Diagrams)
- Database Design
- Interface Design

 **Phase 5: Implementation**
Use appropriate tools and software for system implementations:
- Implement frontend system 
- Implement Backend System
- Use related Database Management Software

 **Phase 6: Testing & Deployment**
Use different testing approaches:
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing 

After the testing phase is completed, deploy the system. The deployment phase includes: 
- Server Setup & Installation
- Basic staff training

 **Phase 7: Maintenance**

In Maintenance Phase, provide:
- User Support
- Documentation (User & System)
- Bug fixes
