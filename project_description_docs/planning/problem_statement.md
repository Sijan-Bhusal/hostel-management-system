# Problem Statement

The current system for hostel management is very
cumbersome and lacks digitization in the age where
everything is becoming easy and controllable via
digital means, like smartphones. This leaves a huge
space for automation.

The main concern for the current mechanical hostel
management method is that there exists no proper and
efficient management system for the owners.

Additionally, there is inefficient or in worst cases,
no communication between the owner of the hostel and
the hostelers. This involves lack of communication of
student problems to the owners, communication of hostel
notices to students, communication of absences of students
to the hostel owners.

Additionally, there's a problem regarding payment tracking
problems for the hostel owners. Hostel owners have no digital
means for tracking who has payments for the month coming up.
They also have no way of knowing who has already paid, or has
yet to pay rents for the current month

These problems grow rapidly as the number of students in the
hostel increases, and as the time of their stay increases,
or the frequency of their stay increases, this makes it
increasingly difficult for the hostel owners to manage
their hostelers. This poses a real problem that needs solving.
