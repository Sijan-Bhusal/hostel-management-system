# How to contribute

For each phase, read the `REFERENCE_TEMPLATE.md`
file, which consists of the template for how the
phase's description should be expanded.

Add a new file for each of the topics you're
contributing to for that phase.

The files will be merged at the end of the phase
to create the complete project description for
that phase.
