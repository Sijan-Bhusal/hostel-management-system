## Background of the Study

A Hostel Management System is a technolgical solution that
enables the hostel whose information system is being created
to monitor the hostelers. It allows the owners of hostel to
register new hostelers when they are enrolled into the hostel,
keep track of the monthly payments and provide an easy access to
information about the hostelers, like contact information,
information on absentees, fee due, and many more.

The idea is not a new one, but has rarely been implemented
in the context of individual hostels in the local vicinity.
This is also a problem that has been in our radar seeing as
to how the owners in hostels of kathmandu are experiencing
these problems frequently.
